R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s) in a regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any variability, and 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability.
Example:

Suppose you have a dataset with two variables: X (independent variable) and Y (dependent variable), and you've built a linear regression model to predict Y based on X.

    Collect Data:
        Gather a dataset with paired observations of X and Y.

    Build a Linear Regression Model:
        Use the data to fit a linear regression model. The model's equation might be: Y=2X+5+ϵY=2X+5+ϵ, where 2 is the coefficient of X, 5 is the intercept, and ϵϵ is the error term.

    Calculate R-squared:

        After fitting the model, calculate the R-squared value. The formula for R-squared is:

        R2=1−Sum of Squares of ResidualsTotal Sum of SquaresR2=1−Total Sum of SquaresSum of Squares of Residuals​

        The numerator represents the amount of variability that the model does not explain (residuals), and the denominator represents the total variability in the dependent variable.

    Interpretation:
        Let's say the calculated R-squared is 0.80.
        Interpretation: 80% of the variability in the dependent variable (Y) is explained by the independent variable (X) in the model. The higher the R-squared, the better the model explains the variability.

    Visualize the Fit:
        Plot the regression line along with the data points to visually assess how well the model fits the data. A good fit is indicated by the regression line closely aligning with the data points.

In summary, R-squared is a measure of how well the independent variable(s) explain the variability in the dependent variable. An R-squared close to 1 suggests a strong relationship, while an R-squared close to 0 indicates a weak relationship. Keep in mind that R-squared alone doesn't indicate the correctness of the model or whether the relationship is causal. It's a measure of the proportion of explained variability.
